 1) Get a recent release of Catspeak from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/NuxiiGit/catspeak-lang/releases).
    You should see a download for a file with the extension `.yymps`.

 2) Open your project file in the GameMaker IDE.

 3) Navigate to the toolbar at the top of the IDE and find "Tools". Click this
    and select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu.

 4) Select the `.yymps` file you downloaded, and follow the wizard to import
    the Catspeak resources. If you're not sure what to import, click "Add All".

Now you're setup, see the [Basic Usage] section for some introductory examples,
or the [Configuration] section for details about what can be customised within
the Catspeak engine.
