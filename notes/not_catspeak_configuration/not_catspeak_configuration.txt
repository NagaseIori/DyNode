The primary method of configuring Catspeak is through the [catspeak_config]
function. This function exposes a struct containing all the global settings,
such as how long processes are allowed to run before they become
unresponsive.

**Please read** the documentation for [catspeak_config] to get an in-depth
description of what each option does.

Below are a couple of examples showing how to read/write configurations:
```
var configs = catspeak_config();

configs.frameAllocation = 0.25; // only run Catspeak for 25% of a frame

configs.processTimeLimit = 5; // all processes can run for 5 seconds
                              // before being forced to stop

// get the current process time limit
var timeLimit = configs.processTimeLimit;
```
